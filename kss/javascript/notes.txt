Introduction to Javascript
********************************
=> Javascript is a programming language of HTML.
=> Javascript is a client side scripting language.
=> Javascript is a high level,untyped language.
=> Javascript is interpreted programming language.
=> Javascript runs in client's browser.
=> Javascript has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.
    (ECMA : European Computer Manufacturer's Association)
=> Javascript is 'object based' language.

Creation of JavaScript
*************************
=>Created in May 1995
=> Javascript is created by Netscape Corporation.
=> Inventor of Javascript : Brendan Eich


DOM(Document Object Model)
***************************
=> DOM Stands for Document Object Model.
=> It is an architecture that defines or treats a document as a collection of objects.
=> It is a concept of dealing with a document that is a collection of various objects.
=> HTML page is a collection of various tags and that tags are treated as objects in Javascript.
=> In Javascript there are some built-in objects of DOM. That objects are used to deal with DOM elements(tags).
    Ex: document,window.

Features of JavaScript
*************************
=> JS provides Client side validation.
=> JS can detect the client's browser and OS.
=> JS is simple.
=> DOM Traversing.
=> DOM Manipulation.
=> Event Handling.
=> Fast Execution.
=> Cross Browser Support.

S/W  Requirements 
********************
=> Web Browser.
=> Text Editor like notepad,notepad++,etc

What are different ways to write JS?
------------------------------------
1) Internal JS:
    => It is written inside the webpage by using script tag.
    => It is recomended to use script tag inside head tag of the webpage.
    Syntax :
        <script>
            // code of JS
        </script>

2) External JS :
    => It is written in an external JS file having extension  .js file.
    => External js file are linked in a webpage by using <script> tag.
    Syntax :
        <script src="path of js file"></script>

Note : There is no way to write inline js. we can just make function callings by using inline method.

Popup box/dialog box in JS:
-----------------------------
=> Popuup box are used to get some input or to display some output to the user.
=> Popup box gets more attention from the user.
=> JS has below three types of popup box -
1) alert()
2) prompt()
3)confirm()

1) alert():
-----------
=> Alert box is used to display some information to the user.
=> It appears with an ok button. User must have to click on OK. So it gets more attention from the user.
Syntax :
    alert("Message Here");

2) prompt() :
-------------
=> It is used to gets some input from the user.
=> We can read any type of value by using this function.
=> It returns the entered number. Hence we have to catch that value in a variable.
=> It appears with an ok and a cancel buton.
Syntax 1: prompt("Message Here");
Syntax 2: prompt("Message Here","Hint Text");
EX: prompt("Enter Your Name : ","Type here...");

3) confirm() :
----------------
=> This function is used to get confirmation from the user.
=> It appears with an ok and a cancel button.
=> If user clicks on OK the it reurns true otherwise it will return false. So it's return type is boolean.

Syntax : confirm("Message");
Ex : confrim("Are you sure to perform this operation");

Event Handling in JS :
***********************
=> Event handling is a process of handling an event in a software.
=> Event is an action performed by user in software screen.
=> A programmer has to write a function to handle the event and then execute that function on occurance of event. This process is known as event handling and this kind of function is known as handler function.

Syntax to create a function in JS :
-----------------------------------
function function_name(list_of_parameters){
    // function code
}

Note: Here "function" is a keyword that is used to define a function in JS.

=> Example of events in JS are : onclick, onchange, onload, onmouseover, onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeyup, etc.

DOM Accessing in JS :
**********************
=> DOM Accessing means accessing the object of a DOM element(tag).
=> It is a process of accessing the object of a tag from a HTML page.
=> It is also known as DOM traversing.
=> To access the object of a tag JS provides a built-in object of DOM. That object is document.
=> document object has a built-in function "getElementById()" that function is used to access the object of specified tag based on their id.
Syntax : 
----------
var name=document.getElementById("Id_of_tag");
Ex: var t=document.getElementById("txt1");

Accessing and modifying content of DOM Elements(DOM Manipulation) :
********************************************************************
=> JS provides the features to access(read) and modify the content of HTML tags during run-time. For that JS provides below properties-
1) value
2) innerText
3) innerHTML

1) value :
----------
=> This property is used to get/set the content of form controls.
=> We can use this property with input tag, select tag and textarea tag.
=> This property can't be used with normal HTML tags.

Syntax to get(read):
--------------------
varName=object_of_tag.value;
Ex 1: 
var x=document.getElementById("txt");
var y=x.value;

Ex 2:
var x=document.getElementById("text").value;

Syntax to set(write):
---------------------
Object_of_tag.value=content;
Ex 1:
var x=document.getElementById("txt");
x.value="Ram Kumar";

Ex 2:
document.getElementById("txt").value="Ram Kumar";
