});
Explanation of above code:
**************************
1) $():
--------
=> It is a jQuery factory function. It means it is main function in jQuery library.
=> $ is short form of "jQuery" function. We can also write jQuery in place of $.
=> This function is used to select an object. We can select built-in objects and also user define object or tags.
Ex in js: var t=document.getElementById("txtname");
Ex in jQuery: var t=$("#txtname");

2) document:
-------------
=>It is a built-in object of DOM. $(document) means we are selecting/passing object of DOM to jQuery library so that jQuery can use that object accordingly.

3) ready() :
------------
=> ready() is an event. It starts execution suddenly when a web page gets loaded completely.
=> We have to pass event handler function inside ready() event to perform some task. Handler functions are generally un-named/annonymous function. But we can also use a named function in that place if we want.
Ex:
function mydemo(){
alert("Welcome to jQuery");
}
$(document).ready(mydemo());

Note: ready() event is equivalent to "onload" event of javascript.
