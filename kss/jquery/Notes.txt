Introduction to JQuery
***********************
=> JQuery is a JavaScript Library.
=> JQuery is developed completely based on JavaScript.
=> JQuery is an open source JavaScript library.
=> JQuery is not replacement of JavaScript. It simplifies the JavaScript tasks.
=> JQuery is a cross-plateform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.
=> JQuery is used to overcome the load on server. Many tasks can be performed in client side by using JQuery.
=> It's punch line is "Write less do more...".

Creation of JQuery: 
********************
=> Jquery was invented by John Resig in 2006.

Features of JQuery:
********************
=> Simple
=> DOM Traversing
=> DOM Manipulation
=> Event Handling
=> Style Modification
=> Effects and Animations
=> AJAX Support
=> JQuery-UI
=> CSS3 Compliant
=> Light Weight Library
=> Cross Browser Support
=> Interpreted

S/W Requirements for JQuery:
---------------------------
=> Web Browser
=> Text Editor
=> JQuery file


$(document).ready(function(){
    alert("Welcome to jQuery");
});
Explanation of above code:
**************************
1) $():
--------
=> It is a jQuery factory function. It means it is main function in jQuery library.
=> $ is short form of "jQuery" function. We can also write jQuery in place of $.
=> This function is used to select an object. We can select built-in objects and also user define object or tags.
Ex in js: var t=document.getElementById("txtname");
Ex in jQuery: var t=$("#txtname");

2) document:
-------------
=>It is a built-in object of DOM. $(document) means we are selecting/passing object of DOM to jQuery library so that jQuery can use that object accordingly.

3) ready() :
------------
=> ready() is an event. It starts execution suddenly when a web page gets loaded completely.
=> We have to pass event handler function inside ready() event to perform some task. Handler functions are generally un-named/annonymous function. But we can also use a named function in that place if we want.
Ex:
function mydemo(){
alert("Welcome to jQuery");
}
$(document).ready(mydemo());

Note: ready() event is equivalent to "onload" event of javascript.

Selectors in jQuery:
********************
=> Selectors are used to select object in jQuery.
=> If we wants to perform some actions on an object then first of all we have to select that object in jQuery.
=> Selecting an object is also known as DOM traversing.
=> Below are the main selectors in jQuery -
1) Id Selector :
-----------------
=> Used to select object of a HTML tag based on Id.
=> We have to use "#" Symbol before the id of tag to select it's object.
syntax :$("#Id_of_tag");

2) Class Selector:
------------------
=> Used to select object of a HTML tag based on css class name.
=> We have to use "." Symbol before the class of tag to select it's object.
syntax :$(".Name_of_css_class");

3) Tag Selector:
-----------------
=> Used to select object of a HTML tag based of tag type.
=> We don't have to use any symbol before the type of tag to select it's object.
Syntax: $("Type_of_Tag");

4) Multiple Selectors:
----------------------
=> It is used to select object of multiple tags at once.
=> We have to use comma(,) symbol between the selector names.
syntax: $("selector1,selector2,.....");
Ex: $("#btn,.btn,button,#para,...");

5) Nested Selector(Parent-child selector):
---------------------------------------------
=> This selector is used to select object of child tag of a parent tag.
=> We have to separate the name of parent and child tag by using white space between them.
Syntax : $("ParentSelector childSelector");
Ex: $("#dv p")

6) Universal Selector:
-----------------------
=> Used to select all tags of webpage.
=> We have to use "*" symbol only.
Ex: $("*");

DOM Manipulation using jQuery:
*******************************
=> jQuery provides features to read and modify content of HTML tags.
=> jQuery provides velow functions for DOM manipulation-
1) val()
2) text()
3) html()
4) attr()
5) prop()

1. val():
---------
=> This function is used to get/set the content of form controls.
Syntax to get:
---------------
varName=Object_Of_tag.val();
Ex: var x=$("txtname").val();

Syntax to set:
---------------
Object_of_tag.val(content);
Ex: $("#name").val("Ramesh Kumar");

Note: val() function is quivalent to "value" property of javascript.

2. text():
-----------
=> This function is used to get/set content of normal HTML controls in plane text formate.
=> We can use this function with div,span,ul,ol,li,h1 etc tags.
Syntax to get:
    varName=Object_of_tag.text();
Ex : var x=$("#mydv").text();

Syntax to set:
    Object_of_tag.text(content);
Ex: $("#mydv").text("Hello World");

3) html():
-----------
=> This function is used to get/set the content of normal HTML controls in HTML text formate.
=> We can use this property with div,span,ul,li,ol,etc.
Syntax to get:
    varName=Object_of_tag.html();
Ex: var x=$("#mydv").html();

Syntax to set:
    Object_of_tag.html(content);
Ex : $("#mysp").html("<strong> Welcome to jQuery </strong>");


4) prop():
-----------
=> This property is used to get/set the property of a HTML tag.
=> Generally it is used to work with disabled, checked and readonly property.
=> prop function works in real datatype. It means it returns the value in actual data type.
Syntax to get:
---------------
varName=Object_of_tag.prop("name of property");
Ex: var x=$("#btn").prop("disabled");

Syntax to set:
--------------
Object_of_tag.prop("name of property","value of property");
Ex: $("#chk").prop("checked",true);

5) attr():
----------
=> Attr stands for attribute.
=> It is used to get/set the attribute of a HTML tag.
=> attr() function works in string type.
Syntax to get:
--------------
varName=ObjectOfTag.attr("NameOfAttribute");
Ex : var x=$("#mypic").attr("src");

Syntax to set:
--------------
ObjectOfTag.attr("NameOfAttribute","ValueForAttribute");
Ex: $("#txt").attr.("type","password");
