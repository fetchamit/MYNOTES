# DataBase Connectivity in .NET
---------------------------------
* Database is used to store data of any software or application permanently.
* In .NET we can connect our software with database by using below mechanisms.
  1. ADO.NET
  2. Entity Framework

Note: Entity Framework internally uses ADO.NET for handling database operations.

* ADO and ADO.NET is two different concept, ADO uses only connected mode of database connection. But in ADO.NET we can establize connection with database in connected and disconnected mode.
