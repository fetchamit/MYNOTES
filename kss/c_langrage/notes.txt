C Programmin Language

ANSI - American National Standerd Institute.

Why to learn c :
-----------------
1) C helps to understand the fundamentals of computer theories.
2) C is very fast in terms of execution time.
3) C is used for writing operating systems as well as doing application level programming.
4) Base of other advance programming languages.
5) Simple to learn.

Introduction to C Language :
-----------------------------
1) C is general-purpose computer programming language.
2) C is a structured(procedural) programming language.
3) C was invented to write UNIX operating system.
4) C is successor of 'Basic Combined Programming Language'(BCPL) called B Language.
5) Linux OS, PHP  and MySQL are written in C.
6) C is a middle level programming language.
7) C language helps to understand the concepts of other languages.

Creation of C :
---------------
* C was originally developed at Bell Labs in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie.
* C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989.
* Latest version of C is C23 that is released in Feb, 2024.

Features of C :
---------------
* Simple to learn.
* Structured Language
* Cross Plateform
* Base of various modern languages.
* Fast Execution
* Middle-level language
* Used in Embedded Application & IOT
* Used to write Kernel of OS

Execution Scenario :
--------------------
Detailed scenario :
===================
Source file -> | Compiler| -> object file -> | Linker |(Loaded Library functions) -> .exe file -> | Loader | -> Execution

Structure of a c program :
--------------------------
* C is a structure programming language. It has a fix structure to write program.
* A C program uses below structure -

  1) Documentation Section :
    => This section is used to write the details about our program by using comment lines.
    => It is an optional section.

  2) Link Section :
    => Used to link header files(libraries) in our program.
    => In this section we have to use "pre-processor" directives to link header files. It is denoted by # symbol.
    => It is an Mandatory section.

  3) Global Declaration Block :
    => This block is used to declare global variables and global functions.
    => It is an optional section.

  4) Main function block :
    A) Declaration Section :
        => Used to declare variables and constants.
        => It is optional section.
    B) Definition section :
        => Used to write statements inside function.
        => It is an essential section.
